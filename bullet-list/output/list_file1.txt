1. Use a dialog box to modify a style (Method 1)
   1.1. Open the Modify Style dialog
      1.1.1. If you're using Word 95, 97 or 2000:
         • From the main menu, Format > Style
         • In the Styles list, choose the style you want to Modify. If you can't find the style you
         want to modify, in the Category box, choose "All Styles". (Tip: You can see a
         description of the style below the Preview.)
         • Click Modify. You're now at the Modify Style dialog.
      1.1.2. If you're using Microsoft Word 2002 or Word 2003:
         • From the main menu, Format > Styles and Formatting.
         • In the panel, find the style you want to Modify. (Note: If you don't see the style
         listed, under Show, choose All Styles. If you still don't see your style listed, tick your
         style and click OK. Then, choose All Styles.)
         • Right-click on the style name and choose Modify. You're now at the Modify Style
         dialog.
      1.1.3. If you're using Microsoft Word 2007 or Word 2010:
         • If you're a keyboard junkie: do ctrl-Shift-S. That opens the Apply Styles pane. Use
         the drop-down list to select a style or type the style name into the box. Tab to the
         Modify button and press Enter. You're now at the Modify Style dialog.
         • If you're a mouse user: on the home tab, in the Styles gallery, right-click the
         thumbnail for the style you want to modify and choose Modify. You're now at the
         Modify Style dialog.
         • If you could not find your style that way, then you need the Styles pane. Press Alt-
         Ctrl-Shift-S to open the Styles pane. Or, click the dialog launcher (the little tiny
         arrow) at the far bottom right of the Styles group. That pops open the Styles pane.
         At the bottom of the Styles pane, click Options and choose to show All styles. Back
         in the Styles pane, find your style in the list, right-click and choose Modify. (Yes,
         Virginia: Microsoft adds more built-in styles to every version of Word. And with
         every version, makes it harder to find them!)
   1.2. Modify your style
      1.2.1.From the Modify Style dialog you can change:
         • The base style for your style (which controls how style cascade).
         • The style to use for the following paragraph. (For example, perhaps you frequently
         type a paragraph using the Title style, and you follow it with a paragraph in style
         Subtitle. You can modify the style Title to be followed by style Subtitle.)
         • If you tick Add to template, your change will be saved in the template on which this
         document is based.
      1.2.2.In the Modify Style dialog, click Format. Choose one of the characteristics of the style
      to modify: Font, Paragraph etc.
      1.2.3.Make your changes and click OK, OK and either Apply or Close.
