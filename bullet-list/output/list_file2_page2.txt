2.2. Put your cursor in a paragraph of the style you want to modify. So if you want to modify the
style Body Text, put your cursor in a paragraph of Body Text style.
2.3. Use Format > Font, Format > Paragraph, Format > Borders and Shading etc to make the
required changes
2.4. If you're modifying a paragraph style, click within the paragraph (so no text is selected) or,
select the whole paragraph (triple-click to select the whole paragraph). If you're modifying
a character style, select one or more characters in that character style.
2.5. From the "Styles" box on the Formatting toolbar, re-choose the name of the style. Word
will ask if you want to update the style, or reapply the current style to the selected text, as
shown in Figure 1. If you want to say sane, do not tick the Automatically Update Style box.
